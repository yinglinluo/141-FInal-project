\title{find the logistic regression with bag of little bootstraps
blbglm is used to fit logistic models. It can be used to carry out regression,
single stratum analysis of variance and analysis of covariance}
\usage{
blbglm(formula, data, m = 10, B = 5000, family)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class "formula" (or one that can be coerced to that class)}

\item{data}{an data frame, list or environment containing the variables in the model.}
